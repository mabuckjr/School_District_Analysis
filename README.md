# School District Analysis

## Overview
In this project, I analyzed the math and reading test scores of highschoolers throughout a school district with 15 schools. Through my analysis, I was able to compare the results in many different fashions:

- A school district summary showing the total number of schools and students; the total annual budget; the average math and reading scores amongst all students, as well as the percentage of students passing math, reading, and both tests.
- A per school summary showing the same information above, but breaking apart the results to show the performance of each high school. The budget per student was also calculated per each student.
- Finding the top and bottom 5 performing schools based on overall passing rate of both tests
- The average math and reading test scores for each grade level at each school
- The test scores by the amount of school spending per student
- The test scores by school size
- The test scores by school type, whether it be a charter or district school

However, before I was able to gather all of this information, I needed to clean up the data since there was academic dishonesty found in 9th grade students at Thomas High School. I replaced all of their scores with "NaN" to ensure that cheating didn't influence the average scores and percentages district-wide.
